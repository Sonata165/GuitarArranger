This tool generates solo guitar arrangements from any MIDI song. It models both left-hand fingering and right-hand picking patterns. The system consists of two main modules: **Voicer**, which finds economical fretboard positions to play melody and harmony simultaneously across all musical blocks; and **Arpeggiator**, which generates picking patterns that simulate the rhythmic feel of the original piece.
